```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## ANGUS 2018

Hi team.  This is some typing.

You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r numbers, echo = FALSE}
n <- 10
seq(n)
```

```{r}

```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
